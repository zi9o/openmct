<a name="overview" href="#overview"><h1 id="undefinedoverview">Overview</h1>
</a><p>The purpose of this document is to review feedback on Open MCT&#39;s
current API and propose improvements to the API, particularly for a
1.0.0 release.</p>
<p>Strategically, this is handled by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying broader goals.</li>
<li>Documenting feedback and related background information.</li>
<li>Reviewing feedback to identify trends and useful features.<ul>
<li>In particular, pull out &quot;pain points&quot; to attempt to address,
as well as positive attributes to attempt to preserve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proposing a set of API changes to address these &quot;pain points.&quot;<ul>
<li>This also takes into account scheduling concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once agreed-upon, formalize this set of changes (e.g. as UML
diagrams) and plan to implement them.</li>
</ul>
<a name="goals" href="#goals"><h1 id="undefinedgoals">Goals</h1>
</a><a name="characteristics-of-a-good-api" href="#characteristics-of-a-good-api"><h2 id="undefinedcharacteristics-of-a-good-api">Characteristics of a good API</h2>
</a><p>A good API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is easy to understand.</li>
<li>Rewards doing things &quot;the right way.&quot;</li>
<li>Saves development effort.</li>
<li>Is powerful enough to support a broad range of applications.</li>
<li>Lends itself to good documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These characteristics can sometimes be at odds with each other, or
with other concerns. These should typically be viewed as participants
in trades.</p>
<a name="evaluating-apis" href="#evaluating-apis"><h2 id="undefinedevaluating-apis">Evaluating APIs</h2>
</a><p>APIs may be evaluated based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of interfaces.<ul>
<li>How many application-specific interfaces do I need to know to
solve a certain class of problems?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Size of interfaces.<ul>
<li>How many methods does each interface have?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Depth of interfaces.<ul>
<li>Specifically, how many methods do I need to call before the return
value is of a form that is not specific to the API?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clarity of interfaces.<ul>
<li>How much documentation or learning is required before an interface is
useful?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consistency of interfaces.<ul>
<li>How similar is one interface to an analogous interface?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Utility of interfaces.<ul>
<li>How much development effort is reduced by utilizing these interfaces,
versus accomplishing the same goals with other tools?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power of interfaces.<ul>
<li>How much application functionality can I influence with the interfaces
that are available to me?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, prefer to have a small number of simple, shallow, clear,
useful, powerful interfaces.</p>
<a name="developer-feedback" href="#developer-feedback"><h1 id="undefineddeveloper-feedback">Developer Feedback</h1>
</a><a name="developer-intern-feedback" href="#developer-intern-feedback"><h2 id="undefineddeveloper-intern-feedback">Developer Intern Feedback</h2>
</a><p>This feedback comes from interns who worked closely with
Open MCT as their primary task over the Summer of 2015.</p>
<a name="developer-intern-1" href="#developer-intern-1"><h3 id="undefineddeveloper-intern-1">Developer Intern 1</h3>
</a><p>Worked on bug fixes in the platform and a plugin for search.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, it was confusing that many things in files that are in
very different locations in the code base refer to each other.<ul>
<li>Perhaps explain more the organization strategy behind the
different main sections, like &quot;commonUI&quot; vs &quot;core&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This may be just me, but there are often long chains of related
functions calling each other, and when I had to modify the behavior,
I had a hard time remembering to look for the highest level function
in the call chain to change. I also sometimes had a hard time finding
the connections between the functions. But, that is important because
the implementation of the functions along the chain may change later.</li>
<li>One very helpful thing that you could add might just be documentation
that is not in paragraph format like in the current developer guide.
I would just like a list of all the functions and members of each kind
of object there is, and descriptions of what they are and how they&#39;re
used.<ul>
<li>Also, the current developer guide pdf&#39;s words that are in &#39;code font&#39;,
rather than the normal text, are not searchable.
(Depending on the pdf viewer.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do appreciate that there is some example code.</li>
<li>I am still slightly confused about what &quot;domainObject&quot; refers to in
different situations.</li>
<li>The tutorials are helpful, but only really for designing new views.
It doesn&#39;t help much with gaining understanding of how the other parts
of the application work.</li>
<li>The general idea of &#39;telemetry&#39; in this context is kind of confusing.
It is hard to figure out what the difference between the various ways of
dealing with telemetry are. e.g., what is the difference between just
&quot;Telemetry&quot; and the &quot;Telemetry Service&quot;? There are many
&quot;Telemetry Thing&quot;s which seem related, but in an unclear way.</li>
</ul>
<a name="developer-intern-2" href="#developer-intern-2"><h3 id="undefineddeveloper-intern-2">Developer Intern 2</h3>
</a><p>Worked on platform bug fixes and mobile support.</p>
<ul>
<li>No guide for the UI and front end for the HTML/CSS part of Open MCT.
Not sure if this is applicable or needed for developers, however would
be helpful to any front end development</li>
<li>Found it difficult to follow the plot controller &amp; subplot
functions/features, such as zooming.</li>
<li>If the developer guide could have for references to which files or
functions are key for gestures, browse navigation, etc it would be
helpful for future developers as a place to start looking. I found
it occasionally difficult to find which files or functions I wanted
at first.</li>
</ul>
<a name="plugin-developer-feedback" href="#plugin-developer-feedback"><h2 id="undefinedplugin-developer-feedback">Plugin Developer Feedback</h2>
</a><p>This feedback comes from developers who have worked on plugins for
Open MCT, but have not worked on the platform.</p>
<a name="plugin-developer-1" href="#plugin-developer-1"><h3 id="undefinedplugin-developer-1">Plugin Developer 1</h3>
</a><p>Used Open MCT over the course of several months (on a
less-than-half-time basis) to develop a
spectrum visualization plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not a lot of time to work on this, made it hard to get up the learning
curve.<ul>
<li>Note that this is the norm, particularly for GDS development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JavaScript carries its own learning curve.</li>
<li>The fact that it pulls in other tools whose APIs need to be learned
also makes the learning curve harder to get up.</li>
<li>Tracking down interconnected parts was a bit difficult.</li>
<li>Could really use examples.</li>
<li>Easy to get lost when not immersed in the style.</li>
</ul>
<a name="plugin-developer-2" href="#plugin-developer-2"><h3 id="undefinedplugin-developer-2">Plugin Developer 2</h3>
</a><p>Used Open MCT over the course of several weeks (on a half-time basis)
to develop a tabular visualization plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain points<ul>
<li>Unable to copy and paste from tutorial pdfs into code<ul>
<li>Wanted to verify my environment was setup properly so that I
could get the final product working in the end without having
to type everything out.  Perhaps there could be something in
github that has the final completed tutorial for new users to
checkout?  Or a step by step one kind of like the tutorials on
the angular js webpage?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typing too long without seeing results of what I was doing<ul>
<li>At some points in the tutorial I ended up typing for the sake
of typing without knowing what I was really typing for.</li>
<li>If there were break points where we could run the incomplete
code and just see a variable dump or something even that would
be helpful to know that I am on the right track.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Documentation on features are a bit hard to find.<ul>
<li>I&#39;m not sure what I can do until I search through examples of
existing code and work my way backwards.</li>
<li>Maybe you can link the features we are using in the tutorial to
their respective parts in the developer guide?  Not sure if that
can be done on PDFs, so maybe a webpage instead?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Positive Attributes<ul>
<li>Unable to copy and paste from tutorial pdfs into code<ul>
<li>I know I also listed this as a pain, but it was kind of helpful
being forced to read and type everything out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Widgets&quot; are self contained in their own directories.  I don&#39;t have
 to be afraid of exploding things.</li>
<li>All files/config that I care about for a &quot;widget&quot; can be found in
the bundles.json</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Misc<ul>
<li>Coming from a not so strong webdev background and on top of that a
zero strong angular background I think starting off with a simple
&quot;Hello World&quot; webpage tutorial would have been nice.<ul>
<li>Start off with a bare bones bundle json with an empty controller
and static &quot;Hello World&quot; in the view</li>
<li>Add the variable &quot;Hello World&quot; into the controller for the view
to display</li>
<li>Add a model property to the bundle.json to take in &quot;Hello World&quot;
as a parameter and pass through to the controller/view</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="long-term-developer-notes" href="#long-term-developer-notes"><h2 id="undefinedlong-term-developer-notes">Long-term Developer Notes</h2>
</a><p>The following notes are from original platform developer, with long
term experience using Open MCT.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bundle mechanism allows for grouping related components across concerns,
and adding and removing these easily. (e.g. model and view components of
Edit mode are all grouped together in the Edit bundle.)</li>
</ul>
<a name="angularjs" href="#angularjs"><h2 id="undefinedangularjs">AngularJS</h2>
</a><p>Angular 2.0.0 is coming (maybe by end of 2015.)</p>
<p>It will not be backwards-compatible with Angular 1.x.
The differences are significant enough that switching to
Angular 2 will require only slightly less effort than switching
to an entirely different framework.</p>
<p>We can expect AngularJS 1.x to reach end-of-life reasonably soon thereafter.</p>
<p>Our API is currently a superset of Angular&#39;s API, so this directly effects
our API. Specifically, API changes should be oriented towards removing
or reducing the Angular dependency.</p>
<a name="angular--39-s-role" href="#angular--39-s-role"><h3 id="undefinedangular-s-role">Angular&#39;s Role</h3>
</a><p>Angular is Open MCT&#39;s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency injection framework.</li>
<li>Template rendering.</li>
<li>DOM interactions.</li>
<li>Services library.</li>
<li>Form validator.</li>
<li>Routing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the problem with frameworks: They become a single point of
failure for unrelated concerns.</p>
<a name="rationale-for-adopting-angular" href="#rationale-for-adopting-angular"><h3 id="undefinedrationale-for-adopting-angular">Rationale for Adopting Angular</h3>
</a><p>The rationale for adopting AngularJS as a framework is
documented in <a href="https://trunk.arc.nasa.gov/jira/browse/WTD-208">https://trunk.arc.nasa.gov/jira/browse/WTD-208</a>.
Summary of the expected benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishes design patterns that are well-documented and
understood in industry. This can be beneficial in training
new staff, and lowers the documentation burden on the local
development team. If MCT-Web were to stay with its current
architecture, significant developer-oriented documentation
and training materials would need to be produced.</li>
<li>The maintainability of MCT-Web would be enhanced by using a
framework like Angular. The local team would enjoy the benefits of
maintenance performed by the sponsor, but would not incur any cost
for this. This would include future upgrades, testing, and bug fixes.</li>
<li>Replaces DOM-manipulation with a declarative data-binding syntax
which automatically updates views when the model data changes. This
pattern has the potential to save the development team from
time-consuming and difficult-to-debug DOM manipulation.</li>
<li>Provides data binding to backend models.</li>
<li>Provides patterns for form validation.</li>
<li>Establishes documented patterns for add-on modules and services.</li>
<li>Supports unit tests and system tests (tests which simulate user
interactions in the browser)</li>
<li>Angular software releases can be expected to be tested, which would
allow MCT-Web developers to focus on MCT-specific features, instead
of the maintenance of custom infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<a name="actual-experience-with-angular" href="#actual-experience-with-angular"><h3 id="undefinedactual-experience-with-angular">Actual Experience with Angular</h3>
</a><p>Most of the expected benefits of Angular have been invalidated
by experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback from new developers is that Angular was a hindrance to
training, not a benefit. (&quot;One more thing to learn.&quot;) Significant
documentation remains necessary for Open MCT.</li>
<li>Expected enhancements to maintainability will be effectively
invalidated by an expected Angular end-of-life.</li>
<li>Data binding and automatic view updates do save development effort,
but also carry a performance penalty. This can be solved, but requires
resorting to exactly the sort of DOM manipulations we want to avoid.
In some cases this can require more total development (writing a
poorly-performing Angular version, then &quot;optimizing&quot; by rewriting a
non-Angular version.)</li>
<li>Expected reduction of test scope will also be invalidated by an
expected end-of-life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hinders integrating non-Angular components. (Need to wrap with
Angular API, e.g. as directives, which may be non-trivial.)</li>
<li>Interferes with debugging by swallowing or obscuring exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<a name="feedback-review" href="#feedback-review"><h1 id="undefinedfeedback-review">Feedback Review</h1>
</a><a name="problem-summary" href="#problem-summary"><h2 id="undefinedproblem-summary">Problem Summary</h2>
</a><p>The following attributes of the current API are undesirable:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] It is difficult to tell &quot;where things are&quot; in the code base.</li>
<li>[ ] It is difficult to see how objects are passed around at run-time.</li>
<li>[ ] It is difficult to trace flow of control generally.</li>
<li>[ ] Multiple interfaces for related concepts (e.g. telemetry) is confusing.</li>
<li>[ ] API documentation is missing or not well-formatted for use.</li>
<li>[ ] High-level separation of concerns is not made clear.</li>
<li>[ ] Interface depth of telemetry API is excessive (esp. <code>TelemetrySeries</code>)</li>
<li>[ ] Capabilities as a concept lack clarity.</li>
<li>[ ] Too many interfaces and concepts to learn.</li>
<li>[ ] Exposing third-party APIs (e.g. Angular&#39;s) increases the learning curve.</li>
<li>[ ] Want more examples, easier-to-use documentation.</li>
<li>[ ] UI-relevant features (HTML, CSS) under-documented</li>
<li>[ ] Good MVC for views of domain objects not enforced (e.g. plots)</li>
</ul>
<a name="positive-features" href="#positive-features"><h2 id="undefinedpositive-features">Positive Features</h2>
</a><p>It is desirable to retain the following features in an API redesign:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Creating new features and implementing them additively is well-supported.</li>
<li>[ ] Easy to add/remove features which involve multiple concerns.</li>
<li>[ ] Features can be self-contained.</li>
<li>[ ] Declarative syntax makes it easy to tell what&#39;s in use.</li>
</ul>
<a name="requirements" href="#requirements"><h2 id="undefinedrequirements">Requirements</h2>
</a><p>The following are considered &quot;must-haves&quot; of any complete API
redesign:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Don&#39;t require usage of Angular API.</li>
<li>[ ] Don&#39;t require support for Angular API.</li>
</ul>
<a name="proposals" href="#proposals"><h1 id="undefinedproposals">Proposals</h1>
</a><a name="requirejs-as-dependency-injector" href="#requirejs-as-dependency-injector"><h2 id="undefinedrequirejs-as-dependency-injector">RequireJS as dependency injector</h2>
</a><p>Use Require.JS for dependency injection.</p>
<p>Dependencies will then be responsible for being sufficiently
mutable/extensible/customizable. This can be facilitated by
adding platform classes which can facilitate the addition
of reusable components.</p>
<p>Things that we usefully acquire via dependency injection currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services.</li>
<li>Extensions (by category).</li>
<li>Configuration constants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Services would be defined (by whatever component is responsible
for declaring it) using <code>define</code> and the explicit name of the
service. To allow for the power of composite services, the
platform would provide a <code>CompositeService</code> class that supports
this process by providing <code>register</code>, <code>decorate</code>, and <code>composite</code>
methods to register providers, decorators, and aggregators
respectively. (Note that nomenclature changes are also implied
here, to map more clearly to the Composite Pattern and to
avoid the use of the word &quot;provider&quot;, which has ambiguity with
Angular.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">define(
  &quot;typeService&quot;,
  [&quot;CompositeService&quot;],
  function (CompositeService) {
    var typeService = new CompositeService([
      &quot;listTypes&quot;,
      &quot;getType&quot;
    ]);

    // typeService has `listTypes` and `getType` as methods;
    // at this point they are stubbed (will return undefined
    // or throw or similar) but this will change as
    // decorators/compositors/providers are added.

    // You could build in a compositor here, or
    // someone could also define one later
    typeService.composite(function (typeServices) {
      // ... return a TypeService
    });

    // Similarly, you could register a default implementation
    // here, or from some other script.
    typeService.register(function (typeService) {
      // ... return a TypeService
    }, { priority: &#39;default&#39; });

    return typeService;
  }
);
</code></pre>
<p>Other code could then register additional <code>TypeService</code>
implementations (or decorators, or even compositors) by
requiring <code>typeService</code> and calling those methods; or, it
could use <code>typeService</code> directly. Priority ordering could
be utilized by adding a second &quot;options&quot; argument.</p>
<p>For extension categories, you could simply use registries:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">define(
  &quot;typeRegistry&quot;,
  [&quot;ExtensionRegistry&quot;],
  function (ExtensionRegistry) {
    return new ExtensionRegistry();
  }
);
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>ExtensionRegistry</code> extends <code>Array</code>, and adds a
<code>register</code> method which inserts into the array at some
appropriate point (e.g. with an options parameter that
respects priority order.)</p>

<a name="arbitrary-html-views" href="#arbitrary-html-views"><h2 id="undefinedarbitrary-html-views">Arbitrary HTML Views</h2>
</a><p>Currently, writing new views requires writing Angular templates.
This must change if we want to reduce our dependence on Angular.</p>
<p>Instead, propose that:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are currently called &quot;views&quot; we call something different.
(Want the term view to be more like &quot;view&quot; in the MVC sense.)<ul>
<li>For example, call them &quot;applications.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consolidate what are currently called &quot;representations&quot; and
&quot;templates&quot;, and instead have them be &quot;views&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>For parity with actions, a <code>View</code> would be a constructor which
takes an <code>ActionContext</code> as a parameter (with similarly-defined
properties) and exposes a method to retrieve the HTML elements
associateed with it.</p>
<p>The platform would then additionally expose an <code>AngularView</code>
implementation to improve compatibility with existing
representations, whose usage would something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">define(
  [&quot;AngularView&quot;],
  function (AngularView) {
    var template = &quot;&lt;span ng-click=&#39;...&#39;&gt;Hello world&lt;/span&gt;&quot;;
    return new AngularView(template);
  }
);
</code></pre>
<p>The interface exposed by a view is TBD, but should provide at
least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to get the HTML elements that are exposed by &amp; managed
by the view.</li>
<li>A <code>destroy</code> method to detach any listeners at the model level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual views are responsible for managing their resources,
e.g. listening to domain objects for mutation. To keep DRY, the
platform should include one or more view implementations that
can be used/subclassed which handle common behavior(s).</p>
<a name="benefits" href="#benefits"><h3 id="undefinedbenefits">Benefits</h3>
</a><ul>
<li>Using Angular API for views is no longer required.</li>
<li>Views become less-coupled to domain objects. Domain objects
may be present in the <code>ViewContext</code>, but this also might
just be a &quot;view&quot; of some totally different thing.</li>
<li>Helps clarify high-level concerns in the API (a View is now
really more like a View in the MVC sense; although, not
completely, so this gets double-booked as a detriment.)</li>
<li>Having a <code>ViewContext</code> that gets passed in allows views to
be more &quot;contextually aware,&quot; which is something that has
been flagged previously as a UX desire.</li>
</ul>
<a name="detriments" href="#detriments"><h3 id="undefineddetriments">Detriments</h3>

<li>Views are still not Views in the MVC sense (in practice,
the will likely be view-controller pairs.) We could call
them widgets to disambiguate this.</li>
<li>Related to the above, even if we called these &quot;widgets&quot;
it would still fail to enforce good MVC.</li>

<p>A <code>Bundle</code> would have a constructor that took some JSON object
(a <code>BundleContext</code>, lets say) and would provide methods for
application life-cycle events. Depending on other choices,
a dependency injector could be passed in at some appropriate
life-cycle call (e.g. initialize.)</p>
<p>This would also allow for &quot;composite bundles&quot; which serve as
proxies for multiple bundles. The <code>BundleContext</code> could contain

<a name="contextual-injection" href="#contextual-injection"><h2 id="undefinedcontextual-injection">Contextual Injection</h2>
</a><p>For extensions that depend on certain instance-level run-time
properties (e.g. actions or views which use objects and/or specific
capabilities of those objects), declare these features as dependencies
and expose them via dependency injection. (AngularJS does this for
<code>$scope</code> in the context of controllers, for example.)</p>
<p>A sketch of an implementation for this might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">function ExtensionRegistry($injector, extensions, getLocals) {
    this.$injector = $injector;
    this.extensions = extensions;
    this.getLocals = getLocals;
}
ExtensionRegistry.prototype.get = function () {
    var $injector = this.$injector,
        locals = this.getLocals.apply(null, arguments);
    return this.extensions.filter(function (extension) {
        return depsSatisfiable(extension, $injector, locals);
    }).map(function (extension) {
        return $injector.instantiate(extension, locals);
    });
};


function ExtensionRegistryProvider(getLocals) {
    this.getLocals = getLocals || function () { return {}; };
    this.extensions = [];
}
ExtensionRegistryProvider.prototype.register = function (extension) {
    this.extensions.push(extension);
};
ExtensionRegistryProvider.prototype.$get = [&#39;$injector&#39;, function ($injector) {
    return new ExtensionRegistry($injector, this.extensions, this.getLocals);
}];
</code></pre>
<p>Extension registries which need to behave context-sensitively could
subclass this to describe how these contextual dependencies are satisfied
(for instance, by returning various capability properties in <code>getLocals</code>).</p>
<p>Specific extensions could then declare dependencies as appropriate to the
registry they are using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">app.config([&#39;actionRegistryProvider&#39;, function (arp) {
    arp.register([&#39;contextCapability&#39;, &#39;domainObject&#39;, RemoveAction]);
}]);
</code></pre>
<a name="benefits" href="#benefits"><h3 id="undefinedbenefits">Benefits</h3>
</a><ul>
<li>Allows contextual dependencies to be fulfilled in the same (or similar)
manner as global dependencies, increasing overall consistency of API.</li>
<li>Clarifies dependencies of individual extensions (currently, extensions
themselves or policies generally need to imperatively describe what
dependencies will be used in order to filter down to applicable
extensions.)</li>
<li>Factors out some redundant code from relevant extensions; actions,
for instance, no longer need to interpret an <code>ActionContext</code> object.
Instead, their constructors take inputs that are more relevant to
their behavior.</li>
<li>Removes need for partial construction, as any arguments which would
normally be appended after partialization can instead be declared as
dependencies. Constructors in general become much less bound to the
specifics of the platform.</li>
</ul>
<a name="detriments" href="#detriments"><h3 id="undefineddetriments">Detriments</h3>
</a><ul>
<li>Slightly increases dependency on Angular; other dependency injectors
may not offer comparable ways to specificy dependencies non-globally.</li>
<li>Not clear (or will take effort to make clear) which dependencies are
available for which extensions. Could be mitigated by standardizing
descriptions of context across actions and views, but that may offer
its own difficulties.</li>
<li>May seem counter-intuitive coming from &quot;vanilla&quot; AngularJS, where
<code>$scope</code> is the only commonly-used context-sensitive dependency.</li>

</a><p>Originally suggested in
<a href="https://github.com/nasa/openmctweb/pull/69#issuecomment-156199991">this comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think there are some grey areas with actions: are they all directly
tied to user input?  If so, why do they have any meaning in the back end?
Maybe we should look at different abstractions for actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>actions</code> - the basic implementation of an action, essentially a
  function declaration. for example, <code>copy</code> requires arguments of
  <code>object</code> and a <code>target</code> to place the object in.  at this level,
  it is reusable in a CLI.</li>
<li><code>context menu actions</code> - has criteria for what it applies to.
  when it is visible, and defines how to get extra &gt; input from a
  user to complete that action. UI concern only.</li>
<li><code>gesture-handler</code> - allows for mapping a <code>gesture</code> to an action,
  e.g. drag and drop for link.  UI Concern only.</li>
</ul>
<p>We could add context menu actions for domain objects which navigate
to that object, without having to implement an action that has no real
usage on a command line / backend.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="benefits" href="#benefits"><h3 id="undefinedbenefits">Benefits</h3>
</a><ul>
<li>Clearly delineates concerns (UI versus model)</li>

<a name="detriments" href="#detriments"><h3 id="undefineddetriments">Detriments</h3>

adding an intermediary between gestures and the actions that they

<p>&ast; Excepting Angular APIs. Internally, continue to use code style
where classes are declared separately from their registration, such
that ubiquity of Angular dependency is minimized.</p>
<p>&dagger; &quot;I think we should limit the third party APIs we expose to
one or two, but I worry it might be counterproductive to
completely hide them.&quot;</p>
<p>&Dagger; Some ambiguity about what to call ourselves if not a platform,
but general agreement that &quot;platform&quot; is not a good term.
More Detail on Pete&#39;s Opinions Here:
<a href="https://github.com/nasa/openmctweb/blob/api-redesign/docs/src/design/proposals/APIRedesign_PeteRichards.md#notes-on-current-api-proposals">https://github.com/nasa/openmctweb/blob/api-redesign/docs/src/design/proposals/APIRedesign_PeteRichards.md#notes-on-current-api-proposals</a></p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Needs to be designed carefully; don&#39;t want to do this with
a complicated interface, needs to be significantly simpler than wrapping
with an Angular directive would be.</p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Agree that we need a new name, but it should not be &quot;application&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Don&#39;t want to expose (or require usage of) third-party
APIs generally. Angular may be an exception in the sense that it is an
API we presume to be present. Can use third-party APIs internally, but
don&#39;t want to support them or be tied to them.</p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Want to have a separate spin-off discussion about
capabilities. Want to consider several alternatives here.
At minimum, though, mixins would be an improvement relative
to how these are currently handled.</p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Agree we want to revise APIs, but this should
be a larger spin-off.</p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Not necessarily as described, but expected to be a
property of composite services in whatever formulation they
take. Should not be default behavior.</p>

<p>&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Need to agree upon details at design-time, but
basic premise is agreed-upon - want to replace
views/representations/templates with a common abstraction
(and hoist out the non-commonalities to other places as appropriate)</p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Beneficial but not strictly necessary (may be
lower-effort alternatives); should prioritize accordingly during planning</p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Some effort will be required to make all of the state
that needs to persist among route changes actually be persistent.
Will want to address this at design-time (will want to look at
libraries to simplify this, for instance)</p>
<p>&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Maybe not all providers, but anywhere there is not a
strong case for building batching into the API we should prefer
simplicity. (Want to pay specific attention to telemetry here.)</p>
