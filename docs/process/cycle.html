<a name="development-cycle" href="#development-cycle"><h1 id="undefineddevelopment-cycle">Development Cycle</h1>
</a><p>Development of Open MCT occurs on an iterative cycle of
sprints and releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>sprint</em> is three weeks in duration, and represents a
set of improvements that can be completed and tested by the
development team. Software at the end of the sprint is
&quot;semi-stable&quot;; it will have undergone reduced testing and may carry
defects or usability issues of lower severity, particularly if
there are workarounds.</li>
<li>A <em>release</em> occurs every four sprints. Releases are stable, and
will have undergone full acceptance testing to ensure that the
software behaves correctly and usably.</li>
</ul>
<a name="roles" href="#roles"><h2 id="undefinedroles">Roles</h2>
</a><p>The sprint process assumes the presence of a <strong>project manager.</strong>
The project manager is responsible for
making tactical decisions about what development work will be
performed, and for coordinating with stakeholders to arrive at
higher-level strategic decisions about desired functionality
and characteristics of the software, major external milestones,
and so forth.</p>
<p>In the absence of a dedicated project manager, this role may be rotated
among members of the development team on a per-sprint basis.</p>
<p>Responsibilities of the project manager including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining (with agreement of stakeholders) a &quot;road map&quot; of work
planned for future releases/sprints; this should be higher-level,
usually expressed as &quot;themes&quot;,
with just enough specificity to gauge feasibility of plans,
relate work back to milestones, and identify longer-term
dependencies.</li>
<li>Determining (with assistance from the rest of the team) which
issues to work on in a given sprint and how they shall be
assigned.</li>
<li>Pre-planning subsequent sprints to ensure that all members of the
team always have a clear direction.</li>
<li>Scheduling and/or ensuring adherence to
<a href="#process-points">process points</a>.</li>
<li>Responding to changes within the sprint (shifting priorities,
new issues) and re-allocating work for the sprint as needed.</li>
</ul>
<a name="sprint-calendar" href="#sprint-calendar"><h2 id="undefinedsprint-calendar">Sprint Calendar</h2>
</a><p>Certain <a href="#process-points">process points</a> are regularly scheduled in
the sprint cycle.</p>
<a name="sprints-by-release" href="#sprints-by-release"><h3 id="undefinedsprints-by-release">Sprints by Release</h3>
</a><p>Allocation of work among sprints should be planned relative to release
goals and milestones. As a general guideline, higher-risk work (large
new features which may carry new defects, major refactoring, design
changes with uncertain effects on usability) should be allocated to
earlier sprints, allowing for time in later sprints to ensure stability.</p>

</a><p>The first three sprints of a release are primarily centered around
development work, with regular acceptance testing in the third
week. During this third week, the top priority should be passing
acceptance testing (e.g. by resolving any blockers found); any
resources not needed for this effort should be used to begin work
for the subsequent sprint.</p>

<a name="process-points" href="#process-points"><h2 id="undefinedprocess-points">Process Points</h2>
</a><ul>
<li><strong>Sprint plan.</strong> Project manager allocates issues based on
theme(s) for sprint, then reviews with team. Each team member
should have roughly two weeks of work allocated (to allow time
in the third week for testing of work completed.)<ul>
<li>Project manager should also sketch out subsequent sprint so
that team may begin work for that sprint during the
third week, since testing and blocker resolution is unlikely
to require all available resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tag-up.</strong> Check in and status update among development team.
May amend plan for sprint as-needed.</li>
<li><strong>Code freeze.</strong> Any new work from this sprint
(features, bug fixes, enhancements) must be integrated by the
end of the second week of the sprint. After code freeze
(and until the end of the sprint) the only changes that should be
merged into the master branch should directly address issues
needed to pass acceptance testing.</li>
<li><a href="testing/plan.html#per-release-testing"><strong>Per-release Testing.</strong></a>
Structured testing with predefined
success criteria. No release should ship without passing
acceptance tests. Time is allocated in each sprint for subsequent
rounds of acceptance testing if issues are identified during a
prior round. Specific details of acceptance testing need to be
agreed-upon with relevant stakeholders and delivery recipients,
and should be flexible enough to allow changes to plans
(e.g. deferring delivery of some feature in order to ensure
stability of other features.) Baseline testing includes:<ul>
<li><a href="testing/plan.html#user-testing"><strong>Testathon.</strong></a>
Multi-user testing, involving as many users as
is feasible, plus development team. Open-ended; should verify
completed work from this sprint, test exploratorily for
regressions, et cetera.</li>
<li><a href="testing/plan.html#long-duration-testing"><strong>Long-Duration Test.</strong></a> A
test to verify that the software remains
stable after running for longer durations. May include some
combination of automated testing and user verification (e.g.
checking to verify that software remains subjectively
responsive at conclusion of test.)</li>
<li><a href="testing/plan.html#unit-testing"><strong>Unit Testing.</strong></a>
Automated testing integrated into the
build. (These tests are verified to pass more often than once
per sprint, as they run before any merge to master, but still
play an important role in per-release testing.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="testing/plan.html#per-sprint-testing"><strong>Per-sprint Testing.</strong></a>
Subset of Pre-release Testing
which should be performed before shipping at the end of any
sprint. Time is allocated for a second round of
Pre-release Testing if the first round is not passed.</li>
<li><strong>Triage.</strong> Team reviews issues from acceptance testing and uses
success criteria to determine whether or not they should block
release, then formulates a plan to address these issues before
the next round of acceptance testing. Focus here should be on
ensuring software passes that testing in order to ship on time;
may prefer to disable malfunctioning components and fix them
in a subsequent sprint, for example.</li>
<li><a href="version.html"><strong>Ship.</strong></a> Tag a code snapshot that has passed release/sprint
testing and deploy that version. (Only true if relevant
testing has passed by this point; if testing has not
been passed, will need to make ad hoc decisions with stakeholders,
e.g. &quot;extend the sprint&quot; or &quot;defer shipment until end of next
sprint.&quot;)</li>
